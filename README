Windows script file to load SketchUp plugins from a portable location.

If you do not have admin privelege on a PC, you are not able to  install all the great SketchUp plugins out there. I wanted a shortcut to start SketchUp and load my plugins.

RunSketchUp.bat - Starts SketchUp and looks in the current directory for the "load_plugins.rb" file.

load_plugins.rb - Loads all .rb files, looks in the current directory for the "Plugins" folder.

Plugins/ - Put your portable plugins here.

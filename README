Windows script file to load SketchUp plugins from a portable location.

If you do not have admin privelege on a PC, you are not able to  install all the great SketchUp plugins out there. I wanted a shortcut to start SketchUp and load my plugins.

RunSketchUp.bat - Starts SketchUp and looks in the current directory for the "load_plugins.rb" file.

load_plugins.rb - Loads all .rb files, looks in the current directory for the "Plugins" folder. *

Plugins/ - Put your portable plugins here.

* Can be substituted by Fredo's 000_AdditionalPluginFolders.rb script. 


It is possible to associate .skp files to the .bat file. This way, double-clicking a .skp model will open SketchUp and load your pugins. However, this will change the icon overlay for .skp files.
